<h2>Project-1:</h2>

<h4>Dapp-Ethereum+IPFS+ReactJS</h4>

<p>Decentralized storage system to store files, websites and other important data.</p>

<h5>Usecase example:</h5>

<p>Let&#39;s say a company &#39;X&#39; has signed a legal agreement with some other company &#39;Y&#39;. Then signed pdf of that agreement was stored on IPFS and the corresponding hash was printed onto the ethereum blockchain.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s assume there was a dispute when one companed(X) claimed the agreement had never been signed. This could easily be disproven by referencing the block where hash of the agreement was added to the blockchain.</p>

<p>Since the hash was added to the Ethereum blockchain at the time of upload to the IPFS network, the signed document was timestamped in a tamperproof way. And, because IPFS provides tamper-proof content retrieval, it can be proven that the content the hash points to hasnâ€™t been altered in any way.</p>
