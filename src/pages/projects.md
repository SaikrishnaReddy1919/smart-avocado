**Please visit my github profile for more projects. For testing I am attaching one video here. Soon I will upload all details about my projects \[From source code to - execution]. Keep watching my github repos.**

**\[This website is still under development...have been trying and testing lot of things...]**

**In future, will upload all videos to a new youtube channel. The project shown in the video below is a private project so you cannot find it in my repos. I will make it public once I done with the todos mentioned in the video.** 

**If you want to contribute to the project just fork the repo, make changes, push it your forked repo then create a pull request. If you are new to github, then check my blogs section to know \`how to create a pull request\`.**
